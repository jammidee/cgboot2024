// This file will guide the developer during the
// configurartion of the template prior to the
// the development of any specific application it
// it is intended to be deployed.
//===============================================


1. The Rights - During configuration of the application the developer must have a clear
		design of the rights to be used in the system.

		cloudgate.js:loadRoleAssigned - will handle all the rights coming from the wavemaker for the global users
		view/layout/cgJsControl.pug - handles all the control of the cgSidebar.pug for the menu.
		genmodules/genusers//views/add.pug, edit.pug has the roles harded-coded during the creation of the users.

2.Global variables from config - settings that will be fixed in the app during its entire deployment. Can be changed by 
		developer only.

		cgconfig.js

3. Config variables (direct accessed by modules) - this is the lowest level of config. Here the developer will set the database
		password, security strings, port to use, etc.

		config.json.

// JMD - 07/03/2019

1. While the application is running, open a browser
2. Access the following URL on the localhost to generate
   rights for this application.
   
   localhost:3000/global/master/init/genrights?entity=[ENTITY]&appid=[APPID]&prefix=[PREFIX]
   
   	[ENTITY] 	- 	the entity where the rights will be generated.
   	[APPID] 	- 	the application ID of the application here the rights will be used.
   	[PREFIX] 	- 	the prefix to be used during the generation of the rightd. Usually
					this is a 3 character code.
